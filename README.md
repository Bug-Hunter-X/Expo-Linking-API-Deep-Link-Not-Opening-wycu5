# Expo Linking API Deep Link Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo Linking API to handle deep links.  The app fails to register deep links properly, preventing the app from opening when a custom URL is tapped.

## Problem

The app does not correctly register the custom URL scheme, causing the deep link to fail. This results in the default browser opening the URL instead of launching the application.

## Solution

The solution involves accurately configuring the app's URL scheme in the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file. It's crucial to ensure that the scheme used in the `Linking.addEventListener` function is consistent with the one specified in the app configuration.  Additionally, proper handling of event listeners and their removal is vital to avoid memory leaks and ensure consistent behavior.  Error handling should be implemented to catch any potential issues during the deep link process.
